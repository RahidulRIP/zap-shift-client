# ZAPSHIFT – On-Demand Parcel Delivery System 📦

ZAPSHIFT is a modern web-based courier platform that simplifies logistics. Users can schedule a parcel pickup from their location, and an available rider is dispatched to collect and deliver it to the final destination.


## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to automate the delivery process. It removes the need for manual phone calls by providing a digital interface where users, riders, and admins can track the lifecycle of a parcel from pickup to delivery.

## ✨ Key Features
- **User Booking:** Easily request a parcel pickup by providing sender/receiver details and parcel type.
- **Rider Dispatch:** Automated or Admin-assigned pickup requests for nearby riders.
- **Role-Based Access:** - **User:** Book parcels and track their status.
  - **Rider:** View assigned pickups and mark parcels as "Delivered."
  - **Admin:** Manage users, riders, and oversee all system logistics.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Monitor whether a parcel is "Pending," "On the Way," or "Delivered."
- **Secure Authentication:** Firebase-powered login for all user roles.
- **Interactive UI:** Smooth transitions with Framer Motion and a clean dashboard using DaisyUI.
